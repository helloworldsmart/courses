*Udacity, Coursera, edX ..等線上課程: 筆記 and 解法*

by Michael Chen (Fork Ty-Lucas Kelley)

### Background

網路上有關學習 Computer Science course 資料很多, 趣味性, free.
就所以資料太多, 反而容易迷茫於資料海(迷茫🐟？), 整理學習地圖, 專注學習吧:dart:
小編受到 Ty-Lucas Kelley 大大啟發而創立這 Repository 來 open source.
整理筆記是最好學習方法之一, 上完course整理Key point和解法, 是學習的過程.
徵戰友跟我一起上course課程吧 :smile:

我寫的筆記玩樂性居多和解法是個人見解, 有issue可以提問!
小編分享資料期許各路大大將會:

1. 形成良性循環的分享精神
2. 受到激勵也做自己的筆記 and 解法吧.
3. 有回饋和討論, 這樣我才能改進我的思路
4. No copy 解法來完成course課程, 我都打嘴砲來寫答案或不小心有意寫好幾層for迴圈.

儘管這在GitHub上公開, 不接受 Pull Requests.
我鼓勵其他大大分享,貢獻, 創自己筆記 and 解法, 畢盡學到是自己.

有些course課當下是swift 2.2, 我updata可能是swift 3.0, 或是變動太快swift 4.0
,我也來不及更新, 以我當下時間點學習為主:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 

Fork From Ty-Lucas Kelley 英文好直接看原出處, 別受我嘴砲影響 :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Enjoy!

### Folder structure

Everything is organized like this:

```
/topicA
    /providerA
        /courseA
        /courseB
/topicB
    /providerA
        /courseA
    /providerB
        /courseB
```

An example would be topic (Computer Science) -> provider (Udacity) -> course (CS 101)

### Topics covered

The focus will be on computer science, math, and engineering courses,
but I have other interests as well, like music and dance.

Below is a list of every course that is either done, in progress, or being taken
soon.
