# Courses:smirk:

*Notes and solutions from various online courses*

by Ty-Lucas Kelley

### Background

There are tons of great, free, and online courses out there.
In fact, there are so many that I will never be able to enjoy taking all of them.
That's what inspired me to create this repository of course notes and solutions;
while simple notes will never be a full replacement for a course experience,
they can at least be a substitute that take much less time to go through.

I write very detailed notes and solutions for every class I take.
I'm sharing them here with the hopes that others will:

1. Benefit from them and share them with others.
2. Be inspired to share their own notes and solutions.
3. Offer feedback and criticism, so I can improve my note-taking.

Despite this being public and on GitHub, I will not accept any pull requests.
This is meant to be a repository of my notes and solutions, not a
community-driven effort. I would encourage those who wish to contribute to
create and share their own notes and solutions.

I will also mention that my notes are not always an exact
representation of what was taught in the class. I sometimes remove what I feel
is unnecessary and add what I feel is supplementary or helpful.

Enjoy!

### Folder structure

Everything is organized like this:

```
/topicA
    /providerA
        /courseA
        /courseB
/topicB
    /providerA
        /courseA
    /providerB
        /courseB
```

An example would be topic (Computer Science) -> provider (Udacity) -> course (CS 101)

### Topics covered

The focus will be on computer science, math, and engineering courses,
but I have other interests as well, like music and history.

Below is a list of every course that is either done, in progress, or being taken
soon.
